                <p>I am Javier Rivera.  Known by most as 'Tat2Javi'.  Born in Riverside, California and raised in the Coachella Valley.  As far back as I can remember I was sketching and drawing anything and everything around me. As I got older hanging in my neighborhood my artwork began to reflect the Chicano lifestyle.  Inspiration could also be found while flipping through the featured artwork in Teen Angel Magazines. Around the age of 16 I began tattooing after an older friend gave me his 'prison rig' made up an old cassette player and some guitar string.  Being a self taught artist my whole life, I took that machine and ran with it.  Developing my craft, while studying others to improve my own skills as an artist.  The dream slowed down as I prepared to be a father.  Working days as everything from a dishwasher to a contractor all while working on tattoos at night, weekends and every other chance I got.  Time started to ware down and it was time to make the jump to yet again, follow my dream.  I finally took the leap of faith and decided to focus 100% on tattooing.  It was all or nothing.  A break came and I started to working at Calreda Tattoo in Wildomar, Ca.  The best part of realizing my dream was for my parents to finally see that I could actually use my art skills to make a good living, to travel the world, and to met other artist from all corners of the globe and all walks of life.<br /><br />
                Today you can find me and my machine at a tattoo convention near you.  I love the fast pace, and the artistic challenge that tattoo conventions provide as well as a place to watch and speak with some of the best in the industry.  Such greats as Jack Rudy, Freddy Negrete, Jose Lopez and so many others.  Tattoo conventions allow you to study and observed all of the different styles and techniques.</p>
